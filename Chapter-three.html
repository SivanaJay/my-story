    <h4>GOING HOME</h4>
    <p>
      I was taken back home when my caretaker was ill and was taken back to the village for treatments. My life began after that.<br>
      We lived in a vey small room with myself, dad and my older siblings, Obi and Eucharia(bless her soul). There my home schooling started by the strong and massive hand of my elder sister (smiles)<br>
      I felt targeted and very much slighted with the way she(elder sister)treated me. Man the home schooling was mad af beatinh ear and dear, with dry eba turning garri stick(LMAOOOO), I felt my life would end <br>
      but see my stupid ass today running codes (LOOOL) from  my home because she stood firm for me during my early childhood. By the time she finished with me i became the best.<br>
      Started primary school, but didn't finish in my home because I had to move again with my elder sis and her husband because ahe needed someone to stay with her. There I finished my primary school. started secondary and had to move again to my elder brothers'<br>
      because my sis was going back to school. There i stayed with my elder bro and his wife till ss2 when i finally moved in with my dad and his 3rd wife.
