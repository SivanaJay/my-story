    <h4>Early struggles</h4>
    <p>
      Life began taking shape for me so early since I wasn't stable in my own family since moving up and down was my calling.<br>
      Therefore the need to be up and doing in making sure I had the necessary for myself since dad wasn't there for me and my elder bro wasn't living <br>
      up to expectation. I took up car washing since it was the only legit source of income in my area that point in time. At night when the bus hustlers <br>
      were done for the day, I'd wash their busses for #100  and I'd do two busses a night and by morning I'd be #200 rich. With that money I sorted out my school uniforms,<br>
      books, sandals, transport, breakfast and lunch at school etc.Since I was basically running my own life. <br>
      The streets I was abandoned into and iI passed through it without it leaving it smelly behind in my life a feat I'm glad I made come to pass.<br>
      My area back then was the center of oloshoism, we had one in my street, had two in an adjacent street and this life i was exposed to was not the kind for a faint heart.<br>
      But we thank God we don't look like wgat we pased through.
