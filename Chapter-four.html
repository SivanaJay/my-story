    <h4>STAYING WITH FATHER</h4>
  <p>
    Staying with father had to be my last choice in all my movements as a young man, was a teenager then and life was making gradual meaning at that time.<br>
    I was in ss2 second term when I started staying with him and a woman who claimed to be his wife. A woman who made sure dad and kids were never in good term <br>
    even my coming was made out of fights and quarels ear and there by my elder sis because my elder brother's wife was a torn in my youg flesh.<br>
    I moved in and it was another hell on earth for my young self. In all it made me the man I am today and I'm overly grateful for those times (sounds weird yeah LOOL).<br>
    One faithful day father almost died from spiritual attack at the house and it took the intervention of my older siblings for him to be revived and that day was the scariest in my life.<br>
    I was legit begging God not to let my father die and he answered and I was happy asf👏 😁.
