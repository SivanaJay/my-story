  <h4>GROWING UP</h4><br>
  <p>
    A life filled with uncertainty when growing up, so much ups and downs. <br>
    A life almost ruined by single parenting and its ills.<br>
    I could also be classified as a child who was malhandled, moved from one foster care home(relatives in Nigeria LOL) to another.<br>
    From when mother died and left a young family to my young dad who had no parental clue whatsoever, it was in shambles before you'd say jack. <br>
    I was mostly migrated like i said initially, and it wasn't a pleasant thing for me.
