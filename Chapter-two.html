    <h4>MY FOSTER HOME</h4>
    <p>
      I was moved from a home in shambles to my first foster home in Agege Lagos when I was still litte. I could remember vividly just playing around and feeling nothing.<br>
      I wasn't in school or something not even in K.G or Nursery classes at least to enhance my senses. I was just left to roam the streets of Agege.<br>
      My caregiver then was a single mom too who had kids in the village but was a courtesan (in polite measures LOL) so i was exposed to that life at a very tender age. I could see men come in and out of our <br>
      room and most time i would be inside pretending to be asleep and then one brother would come in and they'd be humping on the bed (LOL) me and my keen senses would be listening <br>
      it wasn't a pleasant idea or place or environmet to grow up in but we don't look like what we've been through (Smiles).
